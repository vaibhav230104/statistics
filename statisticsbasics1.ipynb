For example, if you have nominal data, you may use chi-square tests to determine if there are any associations or differences between categories. On the other hand, if you have interval or ratio data, you can utilize techniques like t-tests, ANOVA, regression, or correlation analysis to explore relationships, make predictions, or test hypotheses."
